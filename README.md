My exploits journey

### Let's go!

Hey there!
Here I document my journey of learning reversing and exploitations!
This is a skill I've been wanting to learn for a long time :)

### Disclaimer:
- I have basic knowledge in C, CPP, Linux and a little bit of assembly.
- I'm no professional, just a boi trying to learn
- My journey may be different than yours!
