# pwn-journey

Hey there!  
Here I document my journey of learning reversing and exploitations!  
This is a skill I've been wanting to learn for a long time :)  

### Disclaimer:
- I have knowledge in Python, C, CPP, Linux and basic assembly.
- In order to learn memory corruption and binary exploitation these are necessary skills
- I'm no professional, just a boi trying to learn
- My journey may be different than yours!

### Tools:
- Machine: Linux Mint (Debian) x64
- gdb + gef extenstion / IDA

## Step One: Protostar Exploit Exercises!
Link: https://exploit.education/protostar/  
All of the exercises have been compiled and stored under Protostar/binaries :)

> The above is introduced in a simple way,  
starting with simple memory corruption and modification,  
function redirection, and finally executing custom shellcode.
